      <p>
        This guide provides a practical introduction to employing clean
        architecture in Angular applications, leveraging NgRx for state
        management. Clean architecture promotes a well-organized and
        maintainable application structure with decoupled components.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved Maintainability:</strong> Changes in one layer
          (presentation, core domain, or data access) don't ripple through
          others, making maintenance easier.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Enhanced Testability:</strong> Core logic can be tested
          independently of framework specifics, leading to more reliable tests.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Increased Flexibility:</strong> Easier to swap out frameworks
          or components without affecting core code, allowing for future
          adaptability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="facade-title">Leveraging NgRx with Facades</h3>
      <p>
        This guide advocates for using the Facade Pattern with NgRx. The Facade
        Pattern provides a simplified interface to interact with NgRx
        functionalities within your components. It essentially acts as a
        mediator, hiding the complexities of NgRx (actions, reducers, selectors,
        effects) and offering a cleaner way to manage application state.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved Component Readability:</strong> Components interact
          with the Facade instead of directly managing NgRx actions and
          selectors, leading to cleaner and more focused components.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Decoupling:</strong> Components are decoupled from the
          specific implementation details of NgRx, promoting better
          maintainability and testability.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Centralized State Access:</strong> The Facade provides a
          central location for accessing and manipulating application state.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="clean-arch-title">What is Clean Architecture?</h2>
      <p>
        Clean architecture is a software design approach that separates the
        business logic from the framework-specific details. The core domain
        contains application rules and logic, while the presentation and data
        access layers handle framework interaction and data persistence. This
        separation enables independent development and testing of each layer,
        leading to a more resilient and adaptable application.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> Responsible for user interface
          elements, routing, and framework-specific interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Core Domain:</strong> Contains application rules, logic, and
          entities independent of frameworks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Data Access Layer:</strong> Handles data persistence and
          retrieval, interacting with databases or APIs.
        </li>
      </ul>
